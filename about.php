        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>For the first 35 years of his life, Jim Koch's family history and his future career lay in the attic of his
            parent's house.Jim's father Charles Koch, a fifth generation brewer, had left the business but kept the old
            family beer archives upstairs in an old trunk. The recipes hadn't been used since the Louis Koch brewery
            closed during Prohibition and when American tastes went away from full flavored beers.
