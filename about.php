            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>It all started on a farm in Kansas. After the great drought of 1933, Richard Hanson and his mother Verna
                sold the
                family farm and moved east to Rochester in upstate, NY. After struggling for work he became an
                apprentice to his
            uncle, Michael Hanson. Through his apprenticeship Richard learned everything he had to know about the
                brewing process and discovered a new passion. Years passed along with Verna and Michael, who left the
                brewery in
                Richard's capable hands. Richard then proceeded to expand distribution along the east coast and made the
                brewery
                more prosperous than his uncle ever imagined. Today Longshot Brewery has changed a lot since its
                inception, but
                the same family-owned touch still remains.
