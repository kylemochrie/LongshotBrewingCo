        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>It all started on a farm in Kansas. After the great drought of 1933, Richard Hanson sold the family farm and
            moved east to Rochester in upstate, NY. After struggling for work he accepted an apprenticeship from his
            uncle, Michael Hanson. Through his apprenticeship Richard learned everything he had to know about thebrewing
            process and discovered a new passion. After Michael passed away of old age he left the brewery to Richard
            who
            then proceeded to expand distribution along the east coast and made the brewery more prosperous than his
            uncle
            ever imagined. Today Longshot Brewery has changed a lot since its inception, but the same family-owned touch
            still remains.
